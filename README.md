<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
<p align="justify"> Greetings, I'm Toluwani Aremu, a passionate learner and dedicated researcher specializing in advancing responsible AI and human-like visual perception within the realm of computer vision. </p>

<h1 align="center">Skills</h1>
<p align="justify"> With a robust skill set spanning both research and industry, I am well-versed in essential tools such as Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras, among others. Proficiency extends to various Integrated Development Environments, including VSCode, Visual Studio, and PyCharm. </p>

<h1 align="center">Education</h1>
<p align="justify"> My academic journey includes a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Adeleke University, Nigeria, and a subsequent Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. More recently, I achieved a Research-focused Master of Science in Machine Learning at the Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence in December 2022. Presently, I am pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning at MBZUAI, working under the guidance of esteemed mentors: <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=VcOjgngAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Prof. Abdulmotaleb El Saddik</a>,  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2qx0RnEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Karthik Nandakumar</a>, and  <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=en&user=IWcGY98AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Prof. Bhiksha Raj</a>. My research pursuits in the Computer Vision domain encompass a diverse range of topics.</p>

<h1 align="center">Research</h1>
<p align="justify"> As a student at MBZUAI, I served as a Research Assistant at the SPriNT-AI Lab, collaborating with Dr. Karthik Nandakumar. My primary focus was the development of an innovative method known as PolyKervNets, designed to address the Accuracy-Efficiency challenge within Deep Neural Networks, particularly in the context of private inference (PI). Additionally, I embarked on personal projects covering Accented Speech Recognition, Racial Bias Mitigation in SSLs, and Gender Bias Mitigation in Word Embeddings. These projects not only broadened my understanding of AI but also contributed to bias mitigation and performance enhancement in various applications.</p>
  
<p align="justify"> During my Applied Science Internship at G42, I played a pivotal role in developing a toolkit aimed at streamlining the preprocessing of the NHANES dataset, ultimately facilitating model utilization, result reproduction, and TRIPOD statement extraction.</p>
  
<p align="justify"> Subsequently, as an AI research assistant at MBZUAI Metaverse Lab under the guidance of Prof. Abdulmotaleb El Saddik, I embarked on projects to enhance 2D classifiers in the Proactive Violence and Weapon Detection domain, including the leadership of an innovative project known as ScholarFace.</p>

<h1 align="center">Interests and Hobbies</h1>
<p align="justify"> Beyond the realm of academia and research, I am an enthusiast of Futuristic Cities and Philosophy. While my gaming skills may leave something to be desired, I'm always up for a friendly match of FIFA or PES. Physical activities also hold a special place in my life, whether it's sports or hitting the gym for that confidence boost. Music is a constant companion, with a penchant for Folk, while I try my hand at singing, guitar, and piano. In the past year, I've dabbled in photography and am always eager to "shoot" creatively.</p>

<h1 align="center">Socials</h1>
I am open to collaborations and can be reached through the following channels:

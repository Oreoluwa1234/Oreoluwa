<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
<p align="justify">Hi, I'm Oreoluwa Boluwatife Babatunde, a student and dedicated researcher focusing on Natural Language Processing in low-resource regimes.  </p>

<h1 align="center">Skills</h1>
<p align="justify"> With a robust skill set spanning both research and industry, I am well-versed in essential tools such as Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras, among others. Proficiency extends to various Integrated Development Environments, including VSCode, Visual Studio, and PyCharm. </p>

<h1 align="center">Education</h1>
<p align="justify"> My academic journey includes a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Olabisi Onabanjo University.

<h1 align="center">Research</h1>
<p align="justify"> My journey into AI research began during an undergraduate internship at Data Scientist Network. Within the Research and Innovation team, my involvement in audio transcription for an educational ASR project kindled my enthusiasm for NLP. This initial exposure fueled my decision to concentrate my final year project on developing Automatic Speech Recognition for Nigerian-accented English. Notably, this undergraduate research was accepted for presentation at the Deep Learning Indaba, a prominent AI conference in Africa. I also submitted a paper to the Black in AI workshop at the Neurips 2023 conference, and it was accepted as a poster presentation. I've recently had my paper titled "Enhancing ASR with Zero-Shot Learning for Nigerian Accent" accepted for a poster presentation at the Black in AI workshop during the NeurIPS 2023 conference.

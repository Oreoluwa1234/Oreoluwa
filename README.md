<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
<p align="justify"> Hello, I'm Toluwani Aremu, a passionate learner and dedicated researcher. My focus is on advancing Responsible and Human-centered AI in Smart Homes and Cities, with particular emphasis on privacy, fairness, and robustness. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the intersection of Cognitive Sciences, Philosophy, Neuroscience, and Artificial Intelligence. Through my research, I aim to contribute to the development of AI technologies that are not only effective but also ethically sound. </p>

<h1 align="center">Skills</h1>
<p align="justify"> I have a range of research and industrial skills which are useful for technological advancements from either a research perspective, a development perspective or a R&D perspective. Some of the tools I have used are Python, Pytorch, Pytorch Lightning, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Vb.Net, Colab, Power-Bi, Excel and Canva. I am quite proficient with many Integrated Development Environments such as VSCode, Visual Studio, and Notebooks and I have a basic knowledge of MLOps in Cloud Environments like Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and IBM Watson. </p>

<h1 align="center">Education</h1>
<p align="justify"> I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science (Adeleke University, Nigeria), and a Master of Science degree in Computer Science (University of Ibadan, Nigeria). I recently completed my Research focused Masters of Science degree in Machine Learning at the Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (December, 2022). I am currently a PhD student in Machine Learning at MBZUAI, hoping to contribute to the world of responsible and safe AI development.</p>

<h1 align="center">Research</h1>
<p align="justify"> As a student at MBZUAI, I had the opportunity to work as a Research Assistant at the SPriNT-AI Lab, under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2qx0RnEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Karthik Nandakumar</a>. During my time there, I focused on developing a novel method called PolyKervNets, which aimed to address the Accuracy-Efficiency conundrum in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) specifically during private inference (PI). In addition to my work on PolyKervNets, I also undertook personal projects that included Accented Speech Recognition through Disentanglement, Racial Bias Mitigation in SSLs, and Gender Bias Mitigation in Word Embeddings. These projects allowed me to explore various aspects of AI and contribute to mitigating biases and improving the performance of different applications. Prior to this, I served as a Research Assistant at the University of Ibadan, where my focus was on enhancing the strength of classic Cryptographic algorithms while minimizing their impact on speed. This experience provided me with valuable insights into the field of cryptography and its practical applications.</p>
  
<p align="justify"> Recently, I completed an Applied Science Internship at G42, where I contributed to the development of a toolkit designed to aid researchers and medical professionals in preprocessing the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm">NHANES dataset</a>. This toolkit facilitated the utilization of models on the dataset, result reproduction, and the extraction of a TRIPOD statement. It was an enriching experience that allowed me to apply my skills in a real-world context.</p>
  
<p align="justify"> I also worked as an AI researcher at MBZUAI Metaverse Lab, collaborating with <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=VcOjgngAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Prof. Abdulmotaleb El Saddik</a>. My main research endeavors revolved around the enhancement of 2D classifiers in the domain of Violence Detection. I also led an innovative project, called ScholarFace (more details on that soon).</p>

<h1 align="center">Interests and Hobbies</h1>
<p align="justify"> In my free times, I love having a chat about Futuristic Cities, Climate Change, Psychology and Philosophy. I thought I was a gamer, but I suck! Doesn't stop me from granting you an ass-whooping memory on FIFA and PES. I love doing sports, and I am also bad at that, but you will find me difficult to beat. You might catch me every now and then in the gym. It gives me a confidence boost. I listen to music, and my love for Folk (country and rockabilly) tops that aspect. Well, as long as the lyrics are nice, I would love the song. I love singing too, until I listen to my voice. I play the guitar and piano, at least I think I do. Last year, I became interested in photography, and I am a dangerous photographer. Come to me if you want to be 'shot at' sometimes.</p>

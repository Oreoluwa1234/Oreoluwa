<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
I am Toluwani Aremu. As a self-motivated learner and research enthusiast, my main research interests lie in Improving Human-AI Interactions, applying Deep Learning to enhance human-centered Smart Home technologies, Ethical AI and Bias Mitigation, Privacy Preserving ML techniques, Digital Technologies (AI, VR, XR, AR, IoT) for Health & Education. 

<h1 align="center">Skills</h1>
I have a range of research and industrial skills which are useful for technological advancements from either a research perspective, a development perspective or a R & D perspective. Some of the tools I use are Python, Pytorch, Pytorch Lightning, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Vb.Net, Colab, Power-Bi, Tableau, Excel and Canva. I am quite proficient with many Integrated Development Environments and Cloud CI/CD Environments like Azure ML, AWS Sagemaker, Google Cloud AI, IBM Watson, VSCode, Visual Studio, Jupyter Notebook, Github.

<h1 align="center">Education</h1>
I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, from Adeleke University, Nigeria, and a Master of Science in Computer Science from University of Ibadan, Nigeria. I will be completing my Research focused Masters in Machine Learning at MBZUAI in December, 2022.

<h1 align="center">Research</h1>
I am currently working on implementing methods to improve inference latency in Privacy Preserving Deep Learning Models as a Research Assistant at SPriNT-AI Lab, MBZUAI under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2qx0RnEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Karthik Nandakumar</a>. Previously, I was also a Research Assistant at the University of Ibadan, and I worked on improving the security of classic Cryptographic algorithms while preserving its speed.

<h1 align="center">Interests and Hobbies</h1>
In my free times, I love having a chat about Futuristic AI, Future Cities, Climate Change, Psychology and Philosophies. If I get too excited, I might prank you once or twice. I love playing games, and I am bad at that. I love doing sports, and I am also bad at that. You might catch me every now and then in the gym as that improves my confidence. I listen to music, and my love for country and Rock & Roll tops that aspect. I play the guitar, at least that's what I think I do.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![Toluwani-logos__white1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45424924/178520294-d24baafd-9df5-403d-8cd2-94e89172263e.png)

<p class="text-justify"><!-- I am Toluwani Aremu. As a self-motivated learner and research enthusiast, my main research interests lie in Improving Human-AI Interactions, applying Deep Learning to enhance human-centered Smart Home technologies, Ethical AI and Bias Mitigation, Privacy Preserving ML techniques, Digital Technologies (AI, VR, XR, AR, IoT) for Health & Education. 

I have a range of research and industrial skills which are useful for technological advancements from either a research perspective, a development perspective or a R & D perspective. Some of the tools I use are Python, Pytorch, Pytorch Lightning, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Vb.Net, Colab, Power-Bi, Tableau, Excel and Canva. I am quite proficient with many Integrated Development Environments and Cloud CI/CD Environments like Azure ML, AWS Sagemaker, Google Cloud AI, IBM Watson, VSCode, Visual Studio, Jupyter Notebook, Github.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, from Adeleke University, Nigeria, and a Master of Science in Computer Science from University of Ibadan, Nigeria. I will be completing my Research focused Masters in Machine Learning at MBZUAI in December, 2022.

I am currently working on implementing methods for Efficient Encrypted Inference in Deep Learning Models as a Research Assistant at SPriNT-AI Lab, MBZUAI under the supervision of Dr. Karthik Nandakumar. Previously, I was also a Research Assistant at the University of Ibadan, and I worked on improving the security of classic Cryptographic algorithms while preserving its speed.

In my free times, I love having a chat about Futuristic AI, Future Cities, Climate Change, Psychology and Philosophies. If I get too excited, I might prank you once or twice. I love playing games, and I am bad at that. I love doing sports, and I am also bad at that. You might catch me every now and then in the gym as that improves my confidence. I listen to music, and my love for country and Rock & Roll tops that aspect. I play the guitar, at least that's what I think I do.

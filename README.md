<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
<p align="justify"> I am Toluwani Aremu. As a self-motivated learner and research enthusiast, my main research interests lie in Responsible AI development (especially in privacy, fairness, and robustness), Medical Imaging, and Human-centred/Pervasive AI in Smart Cities (Homes, Health, Work). </p>

<h1 align="center">Skills</h1>
<p align="justify"> I have a range of research and industrial skills which are useful for technological advancements from either a research perspective, a development perspective or a R&D perspective. Some of the tools I have used are Python, Pytorch, Pytorch Lightning, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Vb.Net, Colab, Power-Bi, Excel and Canva. I am quite proficient with many Integrated Development Environments such as VSCode, Visual Studio, and Notebooks and I have a basic knowledge of MLOps in Cloud Environments like Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and IBM Watson. </p>

<h1 align="center">Education</h1>
<p align="justify"> I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science (Adeleke University, Nigeria), and a Master of Science degree in Computer Science (University of Ibadan, Nigeria). I recently completed my Research focused Masters of Science degree in Machine Learning at the MBZUAI in December, 2022. </p>

<h1 align="center">Research</h1>
<p align="justify"> I am currently working on implementing methods to improve inference latency in Privacy Preserving Deep Learning Models as a Research Assistant at SPriNT-AI Lab, MBZUAI under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2qx0RnEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Karthik Nandakumar</a>. Previously, I was also a Research Assistant at the University of Ibadan, and I worked on improving the security of classic Cryptographic algorithms while preserving its speed. </p>

<h1 align="center">Interests and Hobbies</h1>
<p align="justify"> In my free times, I love having a chat about Futuristic AI, Future Cities, Climate Change, Psychology and Philosophies. If I get too excited, I might prank you once or twice. I love playing games, and I am bad at that. I love doing sports, and I am also bad at that. You might catch me every now and then in the gym as that improves my confidence. I listen to music, and my love for country and Rock & Roll tops that aspect. I play the guitar, at least that's what I think I do. </p>

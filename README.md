<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
<p align="justify"> I am Toluwani Aremu. As a self-motivated learner and research enthusiast, my main research interests lie in Responsible AI development (especially in privacy, fairness, and robustness), Medical Imaging, and Human-centred/Pervasive AI in Smart Cities (Homes, Health, Work). </p>

<h1 align="center">Skills</h1>
<p align="justify"> I have a range of research and industrial skills which are useful for technological advancements from either a research perspective, a development perspective or a R&D perspective. Some of the tools I have used are Python, Pytorch, Pytorch Lightning, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Vb.Net, Colab, Power-Bi, Excel and Canva. I am quite proficient with many Integrated Development Environments such as VSCode, Visual Studio, and Notebooks and I have a basic knowledge of MLOps in Cloud Environments like Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and IBM Watson. </p>

<h1 align="center">Education</h1>
<p align="justify"> I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science (Adeleke University, Nigeria), and a Master of Science degree in Computer Science (University of Ibadan, Nigeria). I recently completed my Research focused Masters of Science degree in Machine Learning at the Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (December, 2022). </p>

<h1 align="center">Research</h1>
<p align="justify"> My general research interests lie in the Computer Vision domain, specifically in Responsible AI, Medical Imaging, and Pervasive AI applications in Smart Cities. I am also interested in investigating fairness and trustworthiness in Digital technologies leveraging AI techniques (in any domain). At MBZUAI, I worked on a novel method called PolyKervNets to solve the Accuracy-Efficiency conundrum in DNNs during private inference (PI), as a Research Assistant at SPriNT-AI Lab under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2qx0RnEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Karthik Nandakumar</a>. During this time, I also worked on personal projects such as Accented Speech Recognition through Disentanglement, Racial Bias Mitigation in SSLs, Gender Bias Mitigation in Word Embeddings, etc. Previously, I was also a Research Assistant at the University of Ibadan, and I worked on improving the strength of classic Cryptographic algorithms while reducing the compensation on their speed. </p>

<h1 align="center">Interests and Hobbies</h1>
<p align="justify"> In my free times, I love having a chat about Futuristic Cities, Climate Change, Psychology and Philosophy. I thought I was a gamer, but I am not. I only love playing games when I feel like. I love doing sports, and I am also bad at that. That doesn't stop me from doing them and winning. You might catch me every now and then in the gym. It gives me a confidence boost. I listen to music, and my love for country and Rockabilly tops that aspect. Well, as long as the lyrics are nice, I would love the song. I play the guitar, but I think I have overfitted myself to a limited range of music. </p>
